# THE SENTINEL - VR

A virtual-reality version of the classic game The Sentinel ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sentinel_(video_game) ).

It's a slightly simplified version of The Sentinel.  You don't need to create robots; you can just teleport to the destination.

I haven't actually played the original since about 1990, so there may be several other differences.


## How to Play
* To complete each level, you must absorb The Sentinel.  You must be higher than the Sentinel to do this.
* Teleporting around the map costs 1 energy.  You can only teleport to either cubes, or flat land that you can see.
* Build cube to enable you to see higher points, or trees to block the view of the Sentinel.
* If the Sentinel sees you, you will lose 1 energy.  If you lose all your enegy, it is game over.
* Sentries are added after the first level.  They have the same effect as the Sentinel.
* The colour of the landscape denotes status: white means The Sentinel is not looking at you.  Yellow means it is looking in your direction but cannot see you.  Red means it has seen you and your energy is reduced by 1.
* The Sentinel rotates at 3 degress per second, once you have made your first move.
